type: fix
issue: 6124
title: "Previously, when retrieving a resource which may contain other resources, such as a document Bundle, 
a ConsentService's willSeeResource function was still called for the child resources when willSeeResource 
returned AUTHORIZED or REJECTED on the parent resource. This has now been fixed so that if a consent service 
resource returns AUTHORIZED or REJECTED for a parent resource, willSeeResource is not called for the child resources."
